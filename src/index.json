The SGRQ-C has been developed using COPD data, and has not yet been validated for other diseases, but is likely to perform similar to SGRQ. For a detailed background and further instructions please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.healthstatus.sgul.ac.uk/\">http://www.healthstatus.sgul.ac.uk/</a>.</p><p>Both questionnaires have three components: Symptoms (quantifying distress due to respiratory symptoms), activity (the effect of disturbances to mobility and physical activity), and impact (psychosocial impact of disease). A total score provides a global estimate of the respiratory health. The scoring range from 0 to 100 for each component, where a higher number is indicative of poorer health. For the SGRQ, a four unit change has been established as clinically relevant.</p>"
